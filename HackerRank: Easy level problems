WHERE city LIKE 'A%' 
OR city LIKE 'E%' 
OR city LIKE 'I%' 
OR city LIKE 'O%' 
OR city LIKE 'U%'

----- Note: '[aeiou]%' could also be used to query the list of city names starting with vowels

----- 2.) Challenge name: "Higher Than 75 MarKS"
----- Query the Name of any student in STUDENTS who scored higher than 75 Marks.
----- Order your output by the last three characters of each name.
----- If two or more students both have names ending in the same last three characters
----- (i.e.: Bobby, Robby, etc.), secondary sort them by ascending ID.

SELECT name
FROM students
WHERE MARKS > 75
ORDER BY RIGHT(name,3)
      , ID ASC

----- 3.) Challenge name: "Type of Triangle"
----- Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. 
----- Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:
----- Equilateral: It's a triangle with 3 sides of equal length.
----- Isosceles: It's a triangle with 2 sides of equal length.
----- Scalene: It's a triangle with 3 sides of differing lengths.
----- Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.
----- Explanation:

SELECT 
CASE
    WHEN A + B <= C or A + C <= B or B + C <= A THEN 'Not A Triangle'
    WHEN A = B and B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
    WHEN A = B or B = C or A = C THEN 'Isosceles'
    ELES 'Scalene'
END
